# Week 5

## Next weeks goals
Since I totally forgot to write these last time, I'm going to put these first.
- Organize signs to be recorded.
- Determine exactly what questions will be asked in our tests.
- Get a model of a sign being made working in unity

## Unity stuff
We got leap motion working with unity and figured out how to do hand tracking. This was a pretty big deal, as we are now essentially at the point where we just have to connect all the components together to have a working system.
