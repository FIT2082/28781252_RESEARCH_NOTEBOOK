# Week 3

### Project specification
The project specification was completed without issue, and a great deal was learned about writing specifications, and reports in general. We used a design science methodology, which is a research structure centered mainly around designing and producing software with the intent of answering the research question, but can also be used independently from the project. The article we based most of our methodology on can be found here: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e1fa/ec8846289113fdeb840ff3f32d102e46fbff.pdf

### Unity
The unity experiments went quite well, and a lot was learned about both the simplicity and complexity developing for VR in unity.

On one hand, connecting the headset is simple. The OpenVR SDK automatically recognises the headset and does full tracking by itself. Disabling this tracking is slightly more complicated, but is still easily doable.

Connecting the controllers however is much more complicated, or at least it appeared so in the relatively short time span in which I had to play around with it. Luckily OpenVR comes with a number of prefabs that handle the most complicated problems, and hopefully these will be sufficient for our purposes.

Next week we intend to get the leap motion working within unity.
