# Week 8
## Last Weeks Goals
- Figure out how to map our saved hand data onto a hand model

This is turning out to be really hard. We're going to get Han in (the PHD student working on similair stuff) to see if he can have a look at it.
- Start working on algorithm to determine distance between hand and required position.

Really this won't take long at all.
## Starting to make stuff look good
Once mapping hand data is in, and the other thing, we will have gotten through the most algorithmically tought parts of the program will be done. After that, we'll be working entirely on putting it all together in a presentable program.

## Ethics submission
We managed to submit our ethics this week, after many deliberations and revisals to our questions. The go ahead should come around the end of the holidays/sometime week 10. We're hoping to start testing immediately, as long as everything is finished by then.

## Next Weeks Goals
- Figure out the algorithmic stuff
- Put it all together, or at least start to
