# Week 11
## Last Weeks Goals
- If we're lucky, get to do some testing.

No dice.

- Continue the report.

This is gradually happening, naturally some of the parts that went into the poster writing can be reused for the report.

- Finalize the program.

Completely done. Every last bug ironed out, it all works.

- Work on the poster.

This is also done, just in time for the presentation.

## Ethics
Yeah they finally got approved.

## Poster and presentation
Friday is the presentation. We've pretty much already finished the poster, so now we can move onto...

## Testing
We're planning on doing a bunch of testing for our report. If anyone is reading this, please come test our stuff. It's got virtual reality and everything.

## Next Weeks Goals
- The report and presentation
- Lots of testing
