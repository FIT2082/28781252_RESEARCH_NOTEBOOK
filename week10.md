# Week 10
## Last Weeks Goals
- Continue work on the algorithms
Work on the algorithm was indeed continued. We now have a system to draw the loaded hands, and a bunch of other neato features. The problems were fixed, and the planned features were added in. We also gave up on trying to get the points to map to the model, we're just creating our own model.

- Start writing report

We "started" writing the report, however the lack of a template and clear instruction has slightly hindered us in this regard. Progress is continuing though, and hopefully it won't be too stressful once it gets to exam period.

## Poster and presentation
The presentation is week 12, and we have to prepare a poster for it. This hopefully shouldn't be too much of a hurdle, but the lack of any results due to the lack of ethics may be a problem. Speaking of ethics...

## Ethics
Our ethics have been knocked back twice now for small issues. Hopefully they'll be done soon enough for us to at least get a couple tests in. It would really suck to not get to do any of the tests we intended to conduct.

## Next Weeks Goals
- If we're lucky, get to do some testing.
- Continue the report.
- Finalize the program.
- Work on the poster.
