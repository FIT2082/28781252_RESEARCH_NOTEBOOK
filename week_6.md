# Week 6

## Last weeks goals
- Organize signs to be recorded

We've organized to have a native signer record signs for us next thursday. We'll be having them record the entire alphabet, as well as simple signs for next and other useful expressions.

- Determine exactly what questions will be asked in our tests.

We have decided to sort out ethics next week, so this has goal has been pushed back. Given that ethics will take 2 weeks to be passed, submitting it next week gives us weeks 10, 11 and 12 to test.

- Get a model of a sign working in unity

We decided to skip this step, and just go straight to the recording, as we are unsure exactly what format the models recorded by our hardware are going to be in.

## Perception neuron
We spent much of this week attempting to use the perception neuron, a body tracking system similar to those used by professional 3D animation studios. The intention here was to use it to record the movements of the signer so that we could obtain high quality animations of each sign that we need. Unfortunately, after a couple of hours setting up and experimentation, we discovered that the hand tracking is not accurate enough for our purposes.

We will therefore have to look at alternate methods of recording. Currently we intend to use the leap motion to record, and then touch up any inaccuracies manually.

## Next weeks goals
- Determine exactly what questions will be asked in our tests.
- Develop a method to record signs using the leap motion.
- Start working on algorithm for checking distance between required sign and hands.
