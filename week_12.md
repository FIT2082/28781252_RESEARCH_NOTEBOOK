# Week 12
## Last Weeks Goals
- The report and presentation

The presentation went well, plenty of people tried our demo and we received plenty of great feedback for our software. The report is also going.

- Lots of testing

We tested around 10 people, with 5 more scheduled in for SWOTVAC. This will bring us to a nice samplesize of 15, which while not being particularly representative, should give us some nice data.

## Next Weeks Goals
